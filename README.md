# Analyzing-data-from-Transfermarkt-and-Visualizing-Premier-League-Players-Data-Using-Plotly-and-Matplotlib

I want to let you know that I use these data just for my interest (without any commercial purpose).

In this project, I:
1. Get Premier League players data from Transfermarkt (https://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/), which is a German-based website that has footballing information, such as scores, results, statistics, transfer news, and fixtures. Columns that I am gonna use include Name, Jersey Number, Age, Borned date, Club, Position and Nationality.
2. Perform Data cleansing by transforming some variables (Player Value, Age) from string to numeric.
3. Visualize Data using plotly and matplotlib

I will keep update data in other leagues (Bundesliga, Serie A, Ligue 1 and Laliga)!
